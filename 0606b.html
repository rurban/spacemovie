<p>Few films have had as much influence within the Korean film
industry as the 1998 melodrama <a
href="http://koreanfilm.org/kfilm98.html#august"><span
style="font-style: italic;">Christmas in August.</span></a> Despite
its subdued tone and understated themes, the film in many ways
revolutionized the way Korean filmmakers approach melodrama. Director
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hur Jin-ho</span> won over many fans
both in Korea and in the rest of Asia for his ability to infuse
everyday situations with emotion and meaning.</p> 

<p><img style="width: 330px; height: 220px;" class="right"
src="0606/finespr4.jpg" alt="Jealousy" align="right"> For his second
film, Hur chose a universal and somewhat ordinary subject: a man and a
woman who fall in love, and then break up. He says that while his
first film was structured around the beginnings of love, One Fine
Spring Day is more concerned with how it ends. As with his previous
film, the idea of family also plays a big role: the man, Sang-woo,
lives with his father, aunt, and grandmother, relying at times on
their support; Eun-su, the woman, lives alone.</p>

<p>One Fine Spring Day is a gorgeous and yet somewhat abstract sort of
a film, that will bore some viewers and captivate others. Hur has been
called "Korea's Ozu" (he himself is a big fan of the Japanese
director) for the slow pace of his films and his introspective
style. Yet to make this comparison is to ignore how much of Hur's own
<img style="width: 160px; height: 200px;" class="left"
src="0606/posterphoto5769.jpg" alt="DVD Cover"
align="left">personality is stamped on his works. With only two films
he has become an important voice in Korean cinema, and his twisting of
melodrama to make it serve different ends has become a model for many
young Korean filmmakers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;One thing that makes this film particularly special is its
use of sound. The characters themselves are drawn together by sounds
(Sang-woo is a recording engineer, Eun-su is a radio producer), but
everyday sounds, both man-made and natural, make up a crucial aspect
of the film's style. When combined with precise and at times striking
camerawork, the film is able to create moments that are both solemn
and beautiful to see.</p>

<p>Anyone who has been through a painful breakup will likely find
resonance in the situations depicted by this film; part of this film's
strength is its universality. Yet what makes the movie truly special is
the care with which it was made and the quiet force of its personality.

<p>"... The director was present to answer questions, through an
interpreter, and one of his responses indicated that viewers who are
more experienced in love tend to identify with the female lead, while
those less experienced see themselves in the male character." --imdb
